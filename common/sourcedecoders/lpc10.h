/* NOTE ON FRAME SIZE
The VBR codec creates encoded frame sizes of 1, 4, or 7 bytes.
1 byte, silence frames, about 356 bps
4 bytes, unvoiced frames, about 1422 bps
7 bytes, voiced frames, about 2488 bps */

/* NOTE ON DECODING A VBR STREAM
The VBR decoder relies on the frame type encoded into the first
byte of the frame. If you receive a stream of more than one frame
appended together, there is no way for you to know how many times to
call vbr_lpc10_decode() before hand. Therefore, a forth parameter
has been added to vbr_lpc10_decode(), the int *p. *p returns with
a value to tell you how many bytes were in the frame that was just
processed. For example code, see the file decpacket.c, and look at
the function vbrlpc10decode().
