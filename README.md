# EasyDRF

This is a new project to update the WinDRM application, using the latest code from the DLL version, merged with the only available (older) code from the application version. The result will then be updated to fix bugs and add features suitable for Shortwave broadcasting.

This Windows application program is an encoder and decoder for the Ham-DRM standard that is used for sending and receiving files over radio using COFDM modulation. The code was based on the Dream DRM software, and has been modified to reduce it's bandwidth to 2.5kHz.

DRM stands for "Digital Radio Mondiale", and as this was certain to be trademarked, I decided to remove the term from the application name.

The application has been renamed to "EasyDRF" (Easy Digital Radio Files).
