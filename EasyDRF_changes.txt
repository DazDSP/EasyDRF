New Features
------------

Transparent automatic gzip function:
* Compresses file types: html,htm,css,js,xml,json,ico,svg,mid,txt
* Maximum file size 500kB
* Automatic decompress before file save
* Typical compression on html files is about 2.5:1

Automatic sequence add:
* Adds all files in a numbered sequence to the transmit list
* Filename must match for each file
* File extensions can be anything (not matched)
* Numbers can have gaps in their order
* Separator must be a hyphen
* Only the last number group before the dot is processed (incremented)
* Filename can contain numbers and hyphens also - they are matched but not incremented
* Format is: filename-nn.ext
